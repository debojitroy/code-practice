Problem

Design a rate limiter which allows only X request per second

Solution

- Fixed Window
- Divide current time into Fixed windows of window size (S)
- When a new request comes in, check if the request is in the current window
- If in the current window, check the request tracker count and if it is below threshold, allow the request
- If it is a new window, reset the counter and increment by 1 and allow the request
