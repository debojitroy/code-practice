Problem:

Design a mobile snake game
- 2 dimensional board
- snake starts with initial size of 3
- snake grows every 5 seconds
- game ends on crash

Solution

Entities

- Cell
  * Row
  * Col
  * CellType: Empty | snake

- Board
  * rowCount
  * colCount
  * cells -> Cell[]

- Snake
  * SnakeBody -> Doubly Linked List
  * move(cell: Cell) => crashed?

- Game
  * Board
  * Snake
  * play(direction) => game-over?
  * growSnake() -> time based -> Adds a cell to the snakehead
