Problem:

Design a rate limiter which allows X request in the last Y seconds

Solution

- Sliding Window Log
- Keep track of incoming request with timestamp in a List
- For every incoming request
  - Calculate the cutoff
  - Remove the older requests based on the cutoff
  - Check if the length of the list is below the threshold
  - If length is less, then allow the request
